# Requirements and Threat Model Document for zkNFT Ownership Proof

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a zero-knowledge proof system (using zkSNARKs) that demonstrates NFT ownership without revealing the owner’s identity, integrated with standard ERC-721 smart contracts. This allows users to prove that they own a specific NFT while keeping their sensitive information private.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

1. **NFT Proof Generation:**

   - The system must allow users to generate a zkSNARK proof that verifies their ownership of a specific NFT without exposing private keys or identity.
   - Utilize libraries such as snarkjs for constructing and verifying zkSNARK proofs off-chain.

2. **On-Chain Verification:**

   - Integrate proof verification functions within the ERC-721 smart contract.
   - The smart contract should verify the zkSNARK proof and only update the state (e.g., transfer or validation) if the proof is valid.

3. **ERC-721 Standard Compliance:**

   - Maintain all standard functionalities of ERC-721 (minting, transferring, and burning NFTs).
   - Ensure that the added proof logic does not compromise the existing ERC-721 features.

4. **User Interface (UI):**

   - Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to:
     - Generate zero-knowledge proofs.
     - Submit proofs to the blockchain.
     - View verification outcomes and NFT details.
   - Integrate with Web3 libraries (e.g., Ethers.js or Web3.js) to interact with the blockchain.

5. **Secure Key Management:**
   - Implement secure handling of cryptographic keys used in the zkSNARK process.
   - Ensure that any sensitive data (e.g., witness data for proof generation) is never stored or exposed insecurely.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Security:**

   - Ensure robust encryption and data protection throughout the proof generation and verification process.
   - Adopt best practices for secure smart contract development, including thorough testing.

2. **Performance:**

   - Optimize the on-chain verification function to minimize gas consumption.
   - Ensure that off-chain proof generation is efficient and scalable.

3. **Scalability and Modularity:**

   - Design the system to allow future updates, such as additional zero-knowledge protocols or integration with other blockchain standards.
   - Maintain a modular architecture that separates concerns (proof generation, smart contract logic, UI).

4. **Usability:**
   - The UI should be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback mechanisms.
   - Documentation and error messages should guide users in case of issues during proof generation or submission.

## 3. Threat Model

### 3.1 Assets to Protect

- **User Privacy:** Ensure that the user’s identity and private cryptographic keys remain confidential.
- **Proof Integrity:** Maintain the integrity of the zkSNARK proofs to prevent fraudulent proof generation.
- **Smart Contract Security:** Protect the smart contract from vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized transfers or state changes.
- **Overall System Reliability:** Ensure that both off-chain and on-chain components operate securely and reliably.

### 3.2 Potential Threats

1. **Data Exposure:**

   - **Risk:** Leakage of private keys, proof data, or user identity.
   - **Scenario:** An attacker intercepts off-chain communications or exploits insecure key management practices.

2. **Fraudulent Proof Generation:**

   - **Risk:** Malicious actors could attempt to generate fake proofs that appear valid.
   - **Scenario:** Exploiting weaknesses in the zkSNARK circuit or using manipulated inputs to generate misleading proofs.

3. **Smart Contract Exploits:**

   - **Risk:** Vulnerabilities in the smart contract could be exploited (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow, or improper access control).
   - **Scenario:** An attacker manipulates contract functions to bypass proof verification or perform unauthorized transactions.

4. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:**

   - **Risk:** Attacks that target the system’s availability.
   - **Scenario:** Flooding the blockchain network or the off-chain service with requests, hindering proof generation or verification.

5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**
   - **Risk:** Interception and manipulation of communication between the user’s device and the blockchain or proof generation service.
   - **Scenario:** Exploiting unsecured channels to inject false data or extract sensitive information.

### 3.3 Mitigation Strategies

1. **Use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**

   - Leverage the inherent privacy benefits of zkSNARKs to keep user data and private keys confidential.
   - Ensure the circuit design is robust against manipulation or exploitation.

2. **Secure Smart Contract Development:**

   - Follow best practices using well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin.
   - Regularly audit and test smart contracts using both unit tests and integration tests.

3. **Encrypted Communication:**

   - Ensure that all off-chain communications occur over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS).
   - Use encryption for any sensitive data transmitted between components.

4. **Rate Limiting and Monitoring:**

   - Implement rate limiting and monitoring mechanisms on off-chain services to mitigate DoS attacks.
   - Employ logging and alert systems for detecting unusual activity.

5. **Robust Key Management:**
   - Utilize secure storage for cryptographic keys and ensure keys are generated, stored, and used following industry standards.
   - Consider hardware security modules (HSM) or secure enclaves if applicable.
